      <h2>What is the Watch Search Engine?</h2>
      <p>
        The Watch Search Engine is a powerful platform that helps users discover the best watches available
        on the market. With access to a vast database of watch brands and models, it allows users to search, 
        compare, and explore watches based on their preferences.
      </p>

      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>
        The platform aggregates data from various watch manufacturers' websites using web scraping techniques. 
        Information such as brand, model, price, features, and images are collected and stored in a MongoDB 
        database. This data is then made accessible via an intuitive user interface.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We aim to provide users with a fast and seamless experience when searching for watches, ensuring they 
        have all the details they need to make an informed decision.
